# 3.2 Asynchronous Execution Pipeline

Traditional blockchain systems process transactions in this order:

1. Receive transaction
2. Execute transaction
3. Update state
4. Confirm transaction

This sequential process creates unnecessary delays. Spicenet's asynchronous execution pipeline works differently:

Let's walk through what happens when you submit a trade:

1. **Immediate Pre-confirmation** (\~1ms):
   * Your transaction is validated for basic correctness
   * You receive a pre-confirmation if it's valid
   * The sequencer starts preparing the batch
2. **Parallel Processing**:
   * While your transaction is being batched, the sequencer is simultaneously:
     * Executing previous transactions
     * Updating state from earlier batches
     * Processing new incoming transactions
3. **Final Settlement** (30-200ms):
   * Your transaction is included in a batch
   * The batch is posted to Celestia
   * Execution completes and state is updated
   * Full confirmation is achieved

This pipeline means traders can:

* Receive near-instant confirmation of their trades
* Chain multiple operations together quickly
* Achieve predictable execution times
