# 1.2.1 Price Discovery and Matching Systems

The heart of modern markets is the matching engine. Let me create a visual representation of how it works:

The matching engine operates on several key principles:

Price-Time Priority:

* Orders are matched first by price (best prices get priority)
* When prices are equal, earlier orders get priority
* This system ensures fairness and market efficiency

Speed and Capacity:

* Modern engines can process millions of orders per second
* Latency is measured in microseconds
* Complex algorithms optimise order matching
