# 1.2 Modern Market Infrastructure

Modern market infrastructure resembles a well-orchestrated symphony, with multiple components working in harmony to enable efficient trading.

First, let me create a visualisation of the core components:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Trading Interface] --> B[Order Management System]
    B --> C[Matching Engine]
    C --> D[Market Data System]
    D --> A
    C --> E[Clearing House]
    E --> F[Settlement System]
    
    G[Risk Management] --> B
    G --> C
    G --> E
    
    H[Market Surveillance] --> C
    H --> D
    H --> E
    
    subgraph Real-Time Systems
        B
        C
        D
    end
    
    subgraph Post-Trade
        E
        F
    end
    
    subgraph Oversight
        G
        H
    end
```

Let's examine each component in detail in the next sections.
